# Read me for Polygenic Risk Score Analysis

# Every analysis is performed by use of the PRSice software (https://www.prsice.info)

# In the Polygenic_Risk_Score file you will find:
# 1. aaags_phenocov.pheno = example of xphenotype and covariates file for the analysis
# 2. exclusion_nonAAAGS_ID_scirep = exclusion list of patients that are not included in the analysis
# 3. prsice_AAA_XXX_scirep = R based script for using PRSice software > check the software for different settings
# 4. BASEDATA = path to the gwas data for estimated risk effects of included single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or genetic risk variants
# 5. TARGETDATA = path to the genotyped data of your study cohort
#
#
# Make sure all phenotype and covariate names are compatible with each other!
